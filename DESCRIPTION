Description: A consistent, simple and easy to use set of wrappers around the
    fantastic 'stringi' package. All function and argument names (and positions)
    are consistent, all functions deal with "NA"'s and zero length vectors
    in the same way, and the output from one function is easy to feed into
    the input of another.
